# Description

Day Cycle is a generative sound piece built for the web browser. The piece draws from 80 guitar samples, recorded and played by myself, and 1 looped track which is made up of processed fragments from improvisations with a  synthesizer. The work is an extension of music I make with computers as a solo guitar improviser that mostly consists of live processing my instrument through custom DSP algorithms. More recent work has included the sampling of my guitar and "playing it" live through the touch sensitive pads of an AKAI MPC1000. This practice spawned a realization that my guitar playing could in some ways be improved by disembodying the instrument and removing some of my own physical limitations as a player. The number of voices which can be played are only limited to CPU limits on the host computer, and new harmonic relationships can be explored as the distance between notes on the fretboard is collapsed. New programmatic relationships between the triggering of an 'event' and its outcome can be drawn as well, as notes which play can be randomized and create unexpected influences in improvisatory feedback.

The concept of a generative web piece also has a great philosophical and cultural significance to me. As much of our lives have moved online, and become mediated by electronic systems, the process of producing and releasing music ver the past 25 years has more or less stayed the same. Yes, there has been a great rise in social media platforms that have enabled independent and major label artists to reach audiences in unprecedented ways, and the types of processing and access to 'infinite tracks' has enabled new forms of music and production techniques, nevertheless our concept of musical composition is still fixed to constant timelines, where musical events are encoded into immutable files for distribution. As many of our sound works end up in a web app of some sort, whether thats Spotify, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, or our personal websites as embedded files, why not take advantage of the interactive nature of the web? And why not entangle further that music with the possibilities and pitfalls of that technology?

Further inspiration for this piece comes from negative experiences using Soundcloud and the very noisy interface there. It feels like anything posted there is made to compete for attention. A custom webpage however provides a space for work that feels more intentional. A custom environment also gives you more flexibility with determining how a listener might interact with your music, which might allow them to remix or isolate aspects that resonate with them. This environment speaks more to our expectations and nature as 21st century beings, where pinching and zooming, swiping and touching, scrolling, pausing and fast forwarding are taken for granted.
